Welcome to my repository! This is where I document my progress, exercises, and projects as I learn the **Rust programming language**.

I am currently following the official ["The Rust Programming Language"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) book.

## 🗺️ Progress & Roadmap

### Chapter 1: Getting Started
- [x] **Installation & Hello World**
  - **📂 Projects:** [`hello_world`](./hello_world), [`hello_cargo`](./hello_cargo)
  - **💡 Learned:**
    - Installing Rust and `rustup`.
    - Difference between compiling with `rustc` vs `cargo`.
    - Creating and managing projects with Cargo.

### Chapter 2: Programming a Guessing Game
- [x] **Guessing Game Tutorial**
  - **📂 Projects:** [`guessing_game`](./guessing_game)
  - **💡 Learned:**
    - Standard input/output (`std::io`).
    - Mutability with `mut`.
    - Using external crates (`rand`) in `Cargo.toml`.
    - The `match` control flow construct.
    - Comparing values with `std::cmp::Ordering`.

### Chapter 3: Common Programming Concepts
- [x] **Variables & Mutability**
  - **📂 Projects:** [`variables`](./variables), [`data types`](./data_types)
  - **💡 Learned:**
  - Variable declaration wit let.
  - Scalar and Compound types.
  - Data types (int, float, bool, char, tuple, array).
  - Notations with ':'.
  - Mutability with 'mut'.
  - Math operations (+, -, *, /, %).
- [x] **Functions & Control Flow**
  - **📂 Projects:** [`functions`](./functions), [`control_flow`](./control_flow/)
  - **💡 Learned:**
  - Function declaration and usage.
  - Statement vs Expression.
  - Flow of control with `if` statements.
  - Flow of control with `loop`, `while`, and `for`.

### Chapter 4: Ownership
- [x] **Understanding Ownership**
  - **📂 Projects:** [`ownersip`](./ownership/)
  - **💡 Learned:**
    - Ownership rules in Rust.
    - Stack vs Heap memory.
    - owner definition and scope.
    - Ownership transfer.
    - Cloning data.
    - Boxing and heap allocation.
  - 👉 **Next Step: References and Borrowing**
